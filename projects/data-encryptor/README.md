# Data Encryptor CLI Application Using Golang

## Overview
Data Encryptor is a command-line tool built with Golang that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files securely. It takes a file as input, encrypts or decrypts the content, and saves the output in a new file.

## Features
- Encrypts text files securely
- Decrypts encrypted files
- Simple CLI interface using `urfave/cli/v2`

```

## Usage
### Encrypt a File
```sh
go run . encrypt --input "data.txt"
```
This will generate an encrypted file `data_encrypted.txt`.

### Decrypt a File
